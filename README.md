Design Workflow

The design process was initiated in Figma to build a wireframe and establish the framework of the website. This step allowed for:

    Collaborative Design: Planning the layout and structure with input from stakeholders.
    Consistency: Maintaining a unified visual identity with a clear design system.
    Prototyping: Ensuring the design was user-friendly before development began.

The wireframe created in Figma was used as the foundation to guide the website's development.
